    Hello in this program I wrote 3 header files for 3 classes student and course and the complete manging systm
    every header and class has the neede constructors and destructors and getters and setters and other 
    helper methods I needed it while developing the system  , somtimes  you might find extra cout 
    I put it as a comment I used it for debugging  also you might find some extra lines I needed it 
    for while then I changed my mind ^_^ , in  small words this system to creat new student new course
    by using dynmic array and allocation , also you can delete and add new students and courses

    the system is seperated into 3 files like I mentioned befor .





    I wrote comments as much as I could   thanks for your time and enjoy ^_^ 




NOTE: to compile just write make (I did wrote make file ) and after finishing just dont forget to write make clean
